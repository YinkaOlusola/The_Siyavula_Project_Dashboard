The COVID-19 pandemic altered the world’s routines, wreaking havoc on everything from workplace practices to supply chains
to education. In education, it affected an estimated 1.6 billion students worldwide (The World Bank). In Africa, research done by
Human Rights Watch between April and August 2020 found that school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic compounded
previously existing inequalities, leaving children who were already at risk of being excluded from quality education to be most
affected (Human Rights Watch, 2020).

To reach students, many countries in Africa hastily employed some form of remote learning as an emergency response. These
educational responses evolved as the pandemic did.

**Siyavula is known as a pioneer developer of high-quality free digital and print Math and Science textbooks for South African
schools.**

Alongside developing digital workbooks and teachers' guides, Siyavula has also developed an adaptive practice technology called 
Siyavula Practice, that has a complete set of South African curriculum-aligned open textbooks to create an offering for High 
School Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. 

The Siyavula platform has managed to reach the lowest economic segment (Quintile 1 schools) in South Africa. In fact, more than 
50% of the learners using Siyavula Practice attend Quintile 1–3 schools, that is, no- and low-fee schools. Data Description 
Siyavula assisted GDE (Gauteng Department of Education) in 2022 with the creation of a baseline assessment instrument in the 
form of an assignment on the Siyavula platform. The baseline assessment consists of 50 Mathematics curriculum-aligned questions. 
This project is focused on analyzing the results of Grade 8 student's performance on the baseline assessment. This project aims 
to understand gaps in the syllabus and any behavioral patterns. An ideal outcome would be a Power BI dashboard from a 100GB 
database hosted on AWS containing the learner’s information to outline learner performance pre- and post-COVID-19. This 
dashboard will be used by the GDE to make data-driven decisions about where and how to intervene to better address learning needs.
